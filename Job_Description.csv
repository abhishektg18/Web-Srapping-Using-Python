122,Vonage,Senior Data Analyst,5 year,"About the job
Fixed Working hours: 2pm - 10:30pm IST

Vonage BI & Data Team Mission

We are a highly creative, energetic and results-oriented team that owns data and analytics delivery for the entire organization. This starts from data ingestion to corporate dashboards and includes data analytics to drive actions. The successful candidate is passionate about understanding customer needs, motivations, and behavior and enjoys discovering insights that help us deliver better outcomes like revenue growth, better customer experience, customer engagement and customer retention.

Why this role matters

As a Senior Data Analyst, you will be helping us on a journey towards a modern, self-serve analytics organization. You will get autonomy and ownership around large parts of how we interface with users, how they’re trained and around defining the boundary between “let me show you how to do this yourself” and “let me do this for you”.

Over the last couple of years, we’ve made significant investments into our data infrastructure and our data processing platform. This has improved the internal team processes, however, there is still room for improvement on enabling self-serve and using advanced analytics techniques to predict what will happen rather than what happened.

What You Will Do

Work closely with constituents across the business (Sales, Marketing, Product, Customer Experience, Research and Finance)
Develop insights and strategy to drive revenue growth from customer base
Assist in annual budget planning and alignment
Use data mining techniques and analyze core KPI's and generate insight to reach and improve on the target goals
Support scalable client engagement strategies that drive profitable growth, engagement and retention
Be our bridge and ambassador to the rest of the organization, championing for self-service data analytics and maintaining relationships with power users
Be responsible for coordinating our user facing “Data Academy” education initiative to make sure our users can make the most of the data and reporting that we have
Work closely with the rest of the BI & Data team to help make sure the data engineering work being done is well aligned to stakeholder needs

We’re specifically not looking for someone to churn out reports for other people all day long.

Given the size of the team vs the hundreds of users we support, a large part of your work would be focused on finding ways to scale analytics via empowering our users so they are able to do what they are trying to do independently (while having support and training, if they need it).

Self-service analytics environment

We’re using a modern analytics stack with Tableau as the visualization front-end and Snowflake as the DWH, where the majority of report development is done by our users, we also use Python, SQL and Airflow
Rather than a report mill, the BI & Data team is there to empower and help users get their data and analytics work done themselves

What You Will Bring

We’re looking for an experienced analytics professional with practical experience implementing and scaling self-service analytics in a mid-sized organization.

What Is Required

Required: Bachelor’s Degree (preferably in Business, Economics, Statistics or Computer Science) and 5+ years of experience in data analytics role (preferably in a SaaS business)
Required: MBA or Master’s Degree (preferably in Marketing Analytics, Data Science, Operations Research, Industrial Engineering or Computer Science)
Experience working independently with a wide range of stakeholders, from other analysts to senior management
Advanced knowledge of fundamental analytical, statistical techniques, attribution results, forecasting, simulation and data optimization
Strong technical capabilities with SQL, data warehouses, ETL processes, and data integration tools (Python, R coding/familiarity a plus)
Knowledge of Sales, Marketing, Customer Support and Financial (Billing and Accounting) systems
Skilled in Tableau or other BI Tools

Bonus Points If You

Have experience driving self-service analytics adoption in a scalable way
Worked in an agile environment and were able to bring structure where there was none before

What’s In It For You

In addition to providing exciting work, career advancement opportunities, and a collaborative work environment, Vonage provides competitive pay and benefits including unlimited discretionary time off.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3515923583/?alternateChannel=search&refId=%2FRBH3Ox8KHYXDLKz8PHOhw%3D%3D&trackingId=cl8Ae1MBTYvCHFwySj4F%2Fg%3D%3D&trk=d_flagship3_search_srp_jobs

Hrs As a Company

HRS is reinventing the way businesses and governments work, stay and pay in today’s dynamic global marketplace. HRS’ advanced platform technology is extending its reach beyond hospitality to meetings, office space management, payment efficiency and crisis recovery.

Beyond cost savings in the global post-pandemic economy, HRS clients gain from an unrivaled focus on essential aspects including safety, security and satisfaction.

HRS is also recognized for its award-winning Green Stay Initiative , technology that helps corporate hotel programs achieve their NetZero targets, and its groundbreaking Crew & Passengers Solution, which leverages automation to elevate experiences for air and rail operations.

Founded in 1972, HRS works with 35 percent of the global Fortune 500, as well as the world’s leading hotel chains, regional hospitality groups and payment providers.

BUSINESS UNIT

The HRS Data & Analytics Platform is one of the key enablers of HRS Group’s tech and data driven business travel solutions. State of the art services and solutions like strategic consulting & hotel procurement, travel payment and expense solutions or efficient tools to manage corporate meetings and group booking facilitate the travel processes and guarantee savings along the value chain.

Around 50 Data Specialists (Consultants, Analysts, Scientists, Engineers and Working Students) work together in our Data & Analytics organization to create analytics solutions that serve our corporate customers, hotel partners, internal stakeholders, and ultimately millions of business travelers worldwide.

Our Data Consulting team is responsible for transforming complex datasets (procurement data, booking and payment data, rate data, web analytics data, and customer data) into actionable insights to provide decision support and value to customers and business stakeholders.

Each of these datasets keeps records of hotels booked and money spent. However, numbers and details for the different sources cannot just be summed up to obtain the full picture as the same record/ hotel transaction can occur in multiple data sources. Unfortunately, no common identifier is available across data source.

To remedy the situation, HRS Group have designed and successfully implemented an AI-driven data matching solution, that unifies, matches, and consolidates data from the different sources. Customer projects over the past year revealed different scenarios, that prompt for incremental improvements in matching quality and algorithmic refinement.

Your mission is twofold. First, to correct and improve the matching of data when the automated process fails and second, to suggest alternative solutions or improvements to refine and enhance the current matching and consolidation process. Reporting on the matching and consolidation output metrics is also needed.

POSITION

As part of our Data Consulting team, we are looking for a Data Matching and Consolidation Data Analyst based in our Chandigarh office to play a pivotal role in matching customer transactions across multiple sources.

The Analyst will be responsible for analyzing and correcting the matching of internal and external data sources to increase the accuracy of the converged data for business use.

In addition, the role is responsible for liaising with colleagues in the Data Consulting teams to suggest improvements that can enhance the data matching process.

CHALLENGE

Work on matching records from multiple datasets (procurement data, booking and payment data, rate data, web analytics data) to create a single aggregated view of a customer’s data for use by the business teams.
Work closely with the Data Consulting team to ensure the continued development of the AI data matching platform.
Collaborate with colleagues across the HRS Group Data & Analytics organization to establish best-practices, exchange on latest trends, and stay abreast of your area of responsibility.
Work together with the management team to continuously refine and develop HRS Group’s Data Consulting analytics capabilities and strategies

FOR THIS EXCITING MISSION YOU ARE EQUIPPED WITH...

A background or degree in business computer science, data analytics, mathematics or a comparable degree is highly desirable.
Excellent analytical skills to synthesize business implications out of complex data
Excellent communication skills
Superior expertise in Excel and some experience in, or knowledge of, other data and reporting applications such as SQL, Microstrategy
Ability to work independently, reliable and well organized
Eager to learn and experiment and not afraid to fail
Excellent written and verbal English skills

PERSPECTIVE

Access to a global network of a globally united and mutually responsible “Tribe of Intrapreneurs” that is passionately dedicated to renew the travel industry and while doing so reinvent the ways how businesses stay, work and pay.

Our entrepreneurial driven environment of full ownership and execution focus offers you the playground to contribute to a greater mission, while growing personally and professionally throughout this unique journey. You will continuously learn from a radical culture of retrospectives and continuous improvement and actively contribute to making business life better, smarter and more sustainable.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Technology Due Diligence (Associate)

About Technology in Deals

Our Technology in Deals team in the UK has grown rapidly over the last five years and comprises over 30 dedicated Technology specialists. The team works closely with CIOs, CTOs, CDOs and their Technology Functions, to ensure business continuity is delivered throughout the transaction; and value and technology and digital effectiveness is maximised post-deal.

Our team has a wide mix of prior experience, ranging from individuals who have previously worked in industry or private equity running and driving change in Technology Functions, to prior industry CIOs of global businesses, digital start-ups, software development, technology consulting and M&A advisory practices.

Due to continued success and increased demand for our services, we are seeking to expand our team in India with high calibre appointments who will operate as an extension of the UK team supporting the UK Technology M&A business.

About the role

We are looking to recruit a team member who can draw upon their previous consulting or in-house experience to bring high-quality advice and support for our clients. Ideally you will have experience of M&A and /or technology transformational projects, and an understanding of how technology impacts the business and deal.

You will work on a range of projects across different business sectors, whilst also focusing on the full breadth of Technology and Digital review responsibilities including technology applications, infrastructure, organisation and increasingly reviews of the software industry, product management and linkages between revenue growth (including sales & marketing), technology processes, operations, and reporting. You will draw on your previous client / industry experience and knowledge to advise CIOs, CTOs, CDOs and their Technology Functions on key decision making and mitigation of risks throughout the deal.

The work involved can be complex and part of a fast-paced environment, therefore the role will require the ability to quickly understand, analyse and provide trusted opinions on the key issues and opportunities facing the Technology Function. The role will require regular interaction with CXOs and private equity / M&A leaders. As such, you will be expected to work with the UK team, take active and lead role on engagements and management of projects within 6-12 months of joining the team and contribute to the success of the project and deal delivery.

Beyond project work, the role also involves driving business development and internal initiatives, to grow and develop the ways we can help our team and our routes to market. You will utilise your experiences to develop creative and efficient ways to support our clients in the deals environment.

You’ll work as part of a team of problem solvers that work across regions with extensive consulting and industry experience, helping our clients solve their complex business issues. No two days are the same, you will assist in the management of a portfolio of clients and be a part of business development.


Whilst you will be primarily India based, our clients and projects are global in nature. Your personal needs will be taken into consideration and coupled with a range of working environments spanning the office, and flexible working.

As a Deals Technology team member in our Deals Technology team your impact will be seen by:

Pre-deal value creation advice – how will technology impact value for our client in this deal?
Buy and sell side IT due diligence – what is the target’s IT operating model and spend? Is the target’s technology landscape fit for purpose and able to support future growth? What could be improved to unlock further value for our client?
Synergy assessment and planning – what IT cost synergies/dis-synergies are available and how do we plan to capture them?
Carve out and divestment support – what does the IT landscape look like when we carve it out from the parent? How do we transition from the current IT operating model to a standalone or integrated model? How do we support the business during this transition without impacting operations?
Day 1 to Day 100 – how do we safely take control of the technology environment whilst managing risk in the first 100 days?
Integration and optimisation – what is the right level of technology integration to optimise the business and grow value? How do we implement sustainable cost savings? How do we run the integration program?
